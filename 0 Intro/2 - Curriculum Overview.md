## Intro

### What is programming?

A program is a series of instructions given to a computer which perform operations on data, transforming input into output. We write our instructions, or 'source code' in text files, then 'run' those instructions by giving the file to the python interpreter.

### Why Python?

- It has a great community, active development
- It has a wide variety of libraries and resources
- It can be used for game dev, web dev, data science, etc
- It'll be easy to adapt your skills to other languages

### Why Django?

- It has a great community, active development
- It enables the quick development of web applications
- Web dev is very popular (& lucrative)
