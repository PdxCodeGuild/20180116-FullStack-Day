# Python Overview

Python is a popular general-purpose multi-paradigm programming language. General purpose means it can be used for a variety of purposes: desktop applications, [games](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GameProgramming), [embedded systems](https://micropython.org/), web development (Flask and Django), [data science](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/data/15-python-libraries-data-science/), [artificial intelligence](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence) and more. It also means that its core principles carry over to other languages, so you'll be able to more easily broaden your horizon. Python always has an active community with plenty of learning resources, conferences, and libraries. For more information, check out the [Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index) and [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) offers a decent overview.

## Common Built-in Functions

For all the built-in functions, check the [official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)


- I/O
    - input() prompts the user for input on the terminal
    - print() displays text to the user on the terminal
- Arithmetic Functions
    - abs() returns the absolute value of a number
    - round() rounds a number, an optional second argument can specify how many decimal places the output should have
    - min() returns the minimum of the values passed to it
    - max() returns the maximum of the values passed to it
    - sum() returns the sum of the values passed to it
- Type Conversion
    - int() converts a value to an int
    - float() converts a value to a float
    - str() converts a value to a string
    - chr() converts an int to a string containing the character with that unicode value, for example `chr(97)` returns the string 'a'
    - bool() converts a value to a boolean
    - list() converts a value to a list
    - tuple() converts a value to a tuple
    - set() converts a value to a set
    - dict() converts a value to a dict
- List Operations
    - len() returns the length of a list
    - sorted() sorts a list
    - reversed() reverses a list
