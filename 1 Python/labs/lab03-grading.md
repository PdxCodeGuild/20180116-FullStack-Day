# Lab 3: Grading

Let's convert a number grade to a letter grade, using `if` and `elif` statements and comparisons.

## Concepts Covered

- input, print
- type conversion (str to int)
- comparisons (< <= > >=)
- if, elif, else

## Instructions

1. Have the user enter a number representing the grade (0-100)
2. Convert the number grade to a letter grade

## Numeric Ranges

- 90-100: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- 0-59: F


## Version 2

Find the specific letter grade (A+, B-, etc). You can check for more specific ranges using `if` statements, or use modulus `%` to get the ones-digit to set another string to `'+'`, `'-'`, or `' '`. Then you can concatenate that string with your grade string.
