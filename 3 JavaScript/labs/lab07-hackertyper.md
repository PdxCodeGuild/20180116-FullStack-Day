# Lab 7: Hacker Typer

Let's create something similar to [this](http://hackertyper.net/) and [this](http://geektyper.com/). You can use a `textarea` or `pre` to preserve the formatting (html will otherwise strip leading and trailing spaces). Every time the user presses a key, you can add another character to the displayed text. If you use a `textarea`, use `event.preventDefault()` to stop the original character from being typed.

Bonus points for "windows" (`div` with `position:absolute`) randomly opening and closing with their own text. They could have their own text. You could even use a canvas to draw some patterns or charts.
