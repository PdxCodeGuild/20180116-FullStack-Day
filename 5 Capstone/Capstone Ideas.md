- **Citizen Caucus** is an aggregate of information on the US Senate. It features profiles of senators, including their photo, contact information, and voting history on past bills. The data is taken from the [ProPublica API](https://www.propublica.org/) and [Sunlight API](https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/). It also has search with suggestions. By Ronnie Mosley [screenshot](Past%20Capstone%20Screenshots/citizen_caucus.png)
- **Tit4Tat** is, at its most basic concept, designed for people to exchange time for services rendered rather than money. In other words, a person (in my case a filmmaker) will post a project that they have in mind and is looking for help. By looking through other projects they can communicate to the other creator and then commit to each others idea if agreeable. User profiles include skills (type and level), interests, and equipment. By Remington Hendrickson [screenshot](Past%20Capstone%20Screenshots/tit4tat.jpg)
- **Hardcore Lives** keeps track of the local Hardcore shows and bands in Portland. The front page has an instragram embed, a carousel of local venues, and search. There's also a social media component, you can whether you're attending a show and upload flyers of upcoming shows. On the back-end, Beautiful Soup is used to scrape 8 different websites for shows, collecting their title, location, and date. By Michael.
- **Write 2 Learn** features tools to automatically provide feedback to students learning English. Users can make blog posts. One section lets them visualize the parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective) of their posts. Another section highlights any errors that they made. Users can also view charts of their error counts over time and the different counts of the parts of speech in their posts. There's also a page which shows the parts of speech in real time using NLTK. It uses several APIs including the Google Language API. By Ryan.
- **Chanterelle** allows users to write a Todo list with ordered events, represented as a directed acyclic graph. The main view uses [Cytoscape](http://js.cytoscape.org/) to visualize the nodes and edges of the graph. A "next up" list shows only the immediate todo items. Redundant edges are already removed (transitive reduction), as well as cycles. The back-end uses Django Rest Framework and the front-end is in React. By Emyli Poltorak.

- **Food Access** a site which uses d3.js to visualize food access with a choropleth map. It loads an XLSX from [the Food Environment Atlas from the USDA Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/) into a database. The front page then loads the data from the database via AJAX and uses it to populate the map. The front page has a drop-down to select which variable to visualize. There's another page to visualize the correlation matrix between the various variables, and another to see a scatter plot between two selected variables. By Jessica Pavlinko.

### Other Past Capstones

- Disc Caddy is a Django based app that allows disc golfers to keep a virtual version of their disc bag, search local courses, and to see and provide updates on course conditions. You can also check-in to a hole, rate it for playability, leave comments, and post your score. Users can leave comments on a friends' check-in, or just give them a high five. If you provide your score and what disc you threw, Disc Caddy will offer disc suggestions based on what is in your bag and how your score is trending.  By Kasey Watters

- RunAround is a GeoDjango project that automatically builds runs for you based on the most popular runs for your area. You can find safe, popular runs even when you're in new cities or spots you aren't familiar with. It utilizes the Strava API to grab the most popular segments, decomposes them into points ranked by popularity, and then sends those points to the Google Maps API to build a route. Finally, when you've selected the run you'd like, it texts the route to you so you can open it in Google Maps for hands-free turn-by-turn directions on your phone while you run. By Michael Jolliffe
