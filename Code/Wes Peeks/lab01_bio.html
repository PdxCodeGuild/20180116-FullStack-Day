        <h3>Cynicism</h3>
        <p>
            Diogenes was a very controversial figure in ancient Greece, many of his public exploits would land
            people in a cell in modern times.
            Some of his acts included walking around the markets of Athens with a lamp looking for "An honest man," of
            course no one would meet his standard of
            honesty and he would belittle the person and move on to the next. Another time Diogenes was being ridiculed
            by a man for his life-style choice of living amongst
            the dogs in the streets. The man threw scraps of food at Diogenes and for his transgressions against him
            Diogenes proceeded to urinate on the man
            to prove his point of treating someone like something only encourages them to act like that.

            The modern use of the word cynic brings up in one's mind the disdain and disgust that one might view the
            world in. In ancient times though this was hardly the case. The purpose of Cynicism was to live by virtue
            and in accordance to one's own nature. The main approach Cynics had to this
            idea was to live a life free of possessions, wealth, power, fame or sex.
