# Cryptocurrency web app proposal

## Name: 
Currently unknown

## Project Overview
My web application will have tools with insightful tools for making cryptocurrency decisions, as well as yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly charts.  Maybe even down to the millisecond.

I will be using Bitcoin and Ethereum as the main examples for this document.

####  What are the major features of your web application? 
The main feature will be the currency converter in a one page app. All you'll have to do is enter the amount of Ethereum you'd like to convert, ask for their Ethereum address (also for automatic refunds), then ask for the user's Bitcoin address. Then it'll display a deposit address needed to convert the coin. As soon as the amount of Bitcoin is sent to the address provided by the website, it'll automatically convert the coin and send it to the Ethereum address. I'll keep a database of transactions for my protection, as well as link to the blockchain transaction (you could think of blockchain as a transparent record of "transactions" verified by millions of computers).

#### API Creation
Create an API, as well as widget. The easier for the next adopter, the better for everyone.

####  What problem is it attempting to solve? 
Facilitate exchanges between coins without having to login to a confusing exchange website. It'll all be done under the hood, with a small commission for me for making it painfully easy. I'm also trying to teach people more about blockchain practicality and become a resource for blockchain education. I studied environmental science in school, so I would aim for the future of blockchain to be more "green".

####  What libraries or frameworks will you use?
Django / Vue / Javascript / Solidity / Blockchain. Ideally, this would be a one page app (per app). It will swift through the process and have a 1 - 2 - 3 step tiny-tab.

#### Other "apps" on the site
- Cryptocurrency Generator, with different contract types, and automatic deployment so they can soon be listed as an official token or "coin", giving the user to give me their chosen percent for facilitating the process. Potentially pay-what-you-want.
- Fancy list of graphs, with link to their website, and a legitimacy rating.
- Unit Converter. Example: 1 Bitcoin is worth $9999 USD. Example two: 3 Ethereum is worth 730 CAD
- Blog to post updates on blockchain education, since this site's purpose is to educate on this technology.

#### Crucial Features
- Referral system with incentives for getting new users.
- Add referral system so some users can get a percentage of crypto or other assets.
- Reward those who help with a potential ERC20 token, given that the site blows up (which I'm confident it will)
- Newsletter

#### Design
It needs to look 110000000000% legitimate. Branding is key.

#### SEO
We're aiming for the top. Organic growth followed by growth hacking techniques, ads, as well as reaching out to legitimate connections that we have.

#### Security
Constantly monitoring logs, making sure nobody is tampering with high value assets.

#### Newsletter (internet basics)
Automate dynamic newsletters based on back-end info.

The more it expands, the more security it will need, such as Google authorization just to login. But it needs to be simple at first as the pros outweigh the cons.


#### Road map
- Continue adding features
- Build web app using Electron
- Potentially create a wallet system, which allows the users to store funds. Provide private keys so they are in full control of their assets.
- Connect Blockchain/Solidity/Other with jobs.
- Build mobile app.
- Connect with my blockchain networks more and let them know the updates that are coming.

#### Api Integration
I have connections. My network is bigger than I thought.

#### Data Model
username/email, password, referral id, blockchain event log

#### Schedule
- 1-2 weeks for main app
- 2 day for referral/user system
- 1 day for front end
- 5 days for more apps
